<h3>kiana cook</h3><span>company member, contributing choreographer</span>
<p>kiana seeks to keep the integrity of street arts by actively participating in hip hop culture, continuously learning, and passing on the most accurate information to any students she has the honor to teach. she currently lives and teaches in chicago.</p>
<p>philosophy of movement:</br></br>

life energy dances through the world disguised as movement. in that, movement is a primitive force that expresses and heals; ultimately creating meaning.</p>

<h3>chelz jordan</h3><span>company member, contributing choreographer</span>
<p>chelsea has been dancing since the age of 4 training in ballet, hip hop, contemporary and modern. for the past 6 years, she has trained at the joffrey ballet and just finished teaching their summer intensive. chelsea has danced backup for artists like giara, chance the rapper, jamila woods and emily blue, and has performed at venues like lollapalooza and windy city live.</p>
<p>philosophy of movement:</br></br>

dance for me, is an outward expression of sound and/or emotion. it can be created through a set combination of steps, or organically through things like improvisation or layering.</p>
